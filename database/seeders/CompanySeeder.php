As working professionals ourselves, we experienced firsthand the challenges of finding time to brew a good cup of coffee at home and constantly resorting to buying from cafes near the office. That\'s when the idea for Wake The Crew was born.
                Wake The Crew was established in 2020, and a year later in 2021, we set up our first manufacturing facility in Singapore. With growing sales and a growing demand for coffee in the region, we established our 2nd manufacturing facility in Johor, Malaysia, in 2023 to cater to the Malaysian market and aid our export sales.
                With a strong commitment to maintaining high quality products at accessible prices for all our customers, all our production operations are completely in-house, under our direct ownership and management. We are also in the process of achieving HACCP and Halal certification as a testament to our unwavering commitment to the highest manufacturing standards and product quality. As a holistic coffee company, we are working towards taking ownership of the farm to cup process including roasting of our own coffee beans.
                We believe that coffee should be accessible to everyone, anytime, anywhere with our coffee concentrates or through our mobile coffee cart. It\'s a comfort in tough moments and a companion in the best ones. Our Coffee Concentrates were created with the busy consumer in mind â€“ the hustlers, the caffeine addicts, and those who want to start their day right. We\'ve made it easy for you. Just pour, mix, and drink.',
